  <h3 id="headline">Here's a timeline of The Jane Collective:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><b>1965</b>: Heather Booth, a university student involved in the civil rights movement, had a friend in need of an abortion. Booth found a doctor to perform the abortion for her friend. After her friendâ€™s abortion, Booth continued to refer other students in need of abortions to the physician</li>
    <li><b>1967</b>: Several women, including Booth, created a group called the Service, which provided abortions to women of all races, ages, and social classes without requiring them to provide an explanation for their requests.</li>
    <li><b>1969</b>: Officially found and titled "Abortion Counseling Service of Women's Liberation". Since the title was too "wordy", women who called were told they should ask for "Jane"</li>
    <li><b>1972:</b> Two women reported a relative of theirs was receiving an abortion. Two officers arrived at the Collective's apartment and arrested 7 women who were working there, charging them with eleven counts of abortion and conspiracy to commit abortion. One woman removed a stack of index cards from her purse that had the contact information of their patients. They ripped the names and addresses off of the index cards and swallowed them to protect the information.</li>
    <li><b>1973:</b> Abortion is legalised.</li>
